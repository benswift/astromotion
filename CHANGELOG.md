### Fix: inline `![bg right:40%]` split lost when remark-directive is enabled

Consumers that register `remark-directive` (e.g. astro-theme-anu, for `:::`
callout containers) broke inline split backgrounds. Its micromark extension
parses the `:40` in an inline `![bg right:40%]` as a `:40` text directive and
drops it, so the alt reached `remarkDeckBg` as `bg right%` and the slide
silently rendered fullscreen instead of a 40% split (`blur:`/`brightness:`/
`saturate:` filter modifiers were mangled the same way). `@include` partials
were unaffected because `remarkDeckIncludes` parses them with its own processor
that has no `remark-directive` --- which is why split backgrounds only worked
from partials, not the main deck. `remarkDeckIncludes` now strips source
positions from spliced `@include` nodes (their offsets referenced the partial,
not the deck), and `remarkDeckBg` re-reads an inline image's alt from the raw
deck source (`file.value`) via its source offset --- only for genuine inline
images, which are the ones that still carry a position. Inline and included
split backgrounds now behave identically.

### `_if` directive for query-param-gated slides

New `{/* _if: name */}` slide directive sets `data-deck-if="name"` on the
enclosing `<section>`. The deck's Reveal bootstrap removes any such slide whose
query param is absent from the deck URL before `deck.initialize()` runs, so
slide indices and `#/` hashes count only the slides that survive. A slide
tagged `{/* _if: presenters */}` is hidden by default and appears only when the
URL carries `?presenters`. Handled by a new `remarkDeckConditionals` plugin,
slotted into `deckRemarkPlugins` after `remarkDeckClasses`.

### `_animate` directive for Reveal.js auto-animate

New `{/* _animate */}` slide directive (plus `{/* _animate: id */}`) sets
`data-auto-animate` (and `data-auto-animate-id`) on the enclosing `<section>`,
so adjacent slides that both carry it smoothly tween matching elements via
Reveal.js [auto-animate](https://revealjs.com/auto-animate/). Elements match by
`data-id` (authored in your markup/components) or, for headings and paragraphs,
by text content. Ids scope independent sequences: only slides whose ids match
animate across their shared boundary. Handled by a new `remarkDeckAnimate`
plugin, slotted into `deckRemarkPlugins` after `remarkDeckClasses`.

### **Breaking:** deck remark plugins are no longer auto-registered

The integration no longer registers `deckRemarkPlugins` on Astro's global
`markdown.remarkPlugins`. Astro 6.4's `markdown.processor` is a single value
that can't be co-owned by multiple integrations, and the old top-level
`markdown.remarkPlugins` API is deprecated (removed in Astro 8).

Consumers must now wire the exported `deckRemarkPlugins` into their own markdown
processor: with astro-theme-anu, `anuTheme({ extraRemarkPlugins: deckRemarkPlugins })`;
standalone, `markdown: { processor: unified({ remarkPlugins: deckRemarkPlugins }) }`
(`unified` from `@astrojs/markdown-remark`). The plugins still self-gate on
`.deck.mdx`, so they no-op on regular content.

## 2026-05-23

### **Breaking:** `codeTheme` removed, replaced by `shikiConfig`

The `codeTheme: ShikiConfig["theme"]` option only accepted a single theme,
but the README documented passing a dual-theme `{ themes, defaultColor }`
object — which silently bypassed the type. Replaced with `shikiConfig:
ShikiConfig` accepting the full Astro shiki shape (single `theme` or dual
`themes` with optional `defaultColor`).

Migration: rename `codeTheme: "<name>"` → `shikiConfig: { theme: "<name>" }`.

### Plugins registered via global markdown config

`deckRemarkPlugins` now goes onto Astro's global `markdown.remarkPlugins`,
which `@astrojs/mdx` inherits by default (`extendMarkdownConfig: true`).
Previously astromotion only attached the plugins when it owned the mdx
integration; when a theme registered mdx first, the deck plugins silently
fell off and decks rendered as plain MDX (no `<section>` wrapping, `@include`
directives ignored). Each plugin still gates itself on `endsWith(".deck.mdx")`
so the change is a no-op for regular `.md` / `.mdx` files.

### `@include` strips yaml frontmatter

When `{/* @include ./topic.mdx */}` splices an included file's content into
a deck, YAML and TOML frontmatter on the included file are now removed
automatically. This lets a single `.mdx` file double as a standalone Astro
content entry (with frontmatter) and as a deck slide partial.

## 2026-05-12

### `@include` supports bare module specifiers

`{/* @include ... */}` now accepts bare module specifiers in addition to
relative/absolute paths --- e.g.
`{/* @include astro-theme-anu/partials/foo.mdx */}` goes through Node's
package resolution starting from the requesting deck file. The watch plugin
follows the same rule, so HMR still wires up hot-reload on partial edits.
Existing relative paths (`./`, `../`, `/`) behave exactly as before.

## 2026-05-09

### Refresh dependencies

Bumped all dependencies to latest, notably `reveal.js` 5.2 → 6.0 (matches what
consumers like llms-unplugged were already pinning) and `@shikijs/rehype` 3 → 4. Also added the previously missing `remark-smartypants` direct dep that the
plugin pipeline test was importing.

Reveal 6 dropped the `dist/` segment from its package exports, so the CSS
imports in `DeckLayout.astro` and `theme/default.css` were updated from
`reveal.js/dist/reveal.css` → `reveal.js/reveal.css` and similarly for the
black theme.

### Disable Reveal.js scroll view on narrow viewports

Reveal 6 ships `scrollActivationWidth: 435`, which silently switches decks
into a vertical-scroll layout (slides stacked at near-1:1, no scaling) on
viewports ≤435px wide. That broke the assumed invariant that decks always
render onto the fixed 1280×720 canvas scaled to fit. The deck route now
sets `scrollActivationWidth: null`, so portrait mobile viewports get the
same scaled 16:9 layout as desktop --- just smaller.

## 2026-05-08

### Track `@include` partials as Vite watch dependencies

A new dev-only Vite plugin (`astromotion:watch-includes`) scans each
`.deck.mdx` source on transform, walks nested includes up to
`MAX_DEPTH = 10`, registers each resolved partial with Vite's file watcher,
and sends a `full-reload` over the dev WebSocket when a tracked partial
changes. Production builds are unaffected --- this is purely a dev-server
ergonomics change.

Note: in environments where Astro's MDX dev pipeline caches rendered deck
output, a content refresh may still require a manual server restart. The
watch-file registration and reload signal are correct; downstream
effectiveness depends on how Astro invalidates its module/page caches in
your version.

## 2026-05-06

### `fontVariables` option for the Astro 6 fonts API

`astromotion()` now accepts a `fontVariables: string[]` option whose entries
are `cssVariable` names from Astro's top-level `fonts` config. For each
variable, astromotion injects `<Font cssVariable={v} preload />` into the
deck `<head>` --- giving decks self-hosted fonts with automatic preloading,
subsetting, and `font-fallback` metrics.

```ts
import { fontProviders } from "astro/config";

defineConfig({
  fonts: [
    {
      provider: fontProviders.google(),
      name: "Public Sans",
      cssVariable: "--font-public-sans",
    },
  ],
  integrations: [
    astromotion({
      theme: "./src/decks/theme.css",
      fontVariables: ["--font-public-sans"],
    }),
  ],
});
```

Consuming themes can reference the variable directly
(`var(--font-public-sans, "Public Sans")`) or rely on the `@font-face`
rule emitted by `<Font>` to register the family by its plain name.

### Breaking: unified `.deck.mdx` format

`.deck.md` and `.deck.svelte` paths are removed. Decks are now authored as
`.deck.mdx` files processed by Astro's MDX integration with a set of custom
remark plugins (lifted from the previous bespoke pipeline).

**Why:** the previous split forced authors to choose between server-rendered
markdown (`.deck.md`, no components) and client-only Svelte (`.deck.svelte`,
full Svelte runtime, no SSR). The new format gives islands-style hydration:
SSR by default, per-component opt-in to client-side hydration via Astro's
`client:*` directives.

**Migration:** Rename `*.deck.md` and `*.deck.svelte` → `*.deck.mdx`. For
files that had a `<script lang="ts">` block, lift its contents to top-level
MDX `import` and `export const` statements (drop the `<script>` wrapper).

Convert directive syntax from HTML comments to MDX expression syntax:
`<!-- @include ./path -->` → `{/* @include ./path.mdx */}`,
`<!-- _class: name -->` → `{/* _class: name */}`,
`<!-- notes: ... -->` → `{/* notes: ... */}`. The bg image syntax
(`![bg ...](url)`), QR images (`![qr](url)`), and slide separators (`---`)
are unchanged.

`@astrojs/svelte` is no longer a peer dependency. `@astrojs/mdx` is now
required.

### Slides now render onto a fixed 1280×720 canvas

Reveal.js's `disableLayout: true` flag has been dropped from both the `.deck.md`
catch-all route and the `.deck.svelte` preprocessor. With layout enabled,
Reveal renders slides at the configured 1280×720 canvas and applies a
`transform: scale()` to fit the viewport, so a deck looks pixel-identical at
any resolution from a thumbnail up to 4K.

`maxScale: 4` was added alongside the flip to lift Reveal's default 2.0 scale
cap, which would otherwise letterbox 4K monitors (3.0× scale needed). The
`display: "grid"` Reveal option remains, so consuming themes can keep using
`place-content: center` on sections.

**Behaviour change for authors:** the slide canvas was previously
viewport-sized (e.g. 1920×1080 on a full-HD monitor); it is now a fixed
1280×720. Decks authored to fit a stretched viewport may need their content
trimmed to fit a 720-tall canvas. Typical content sizes in the
`astro-theme-anu` deck.css fit comfortably; very dense slides should be
spot-checked.

**No theme-CSS changes required.** Consuming themes' rem/px sizing, padding,
`place-content` rules, absolute positioning, and split/QR layouts all work the
same way against a fixed canvas as they did against a viewport-sized one.

### Image resolution rewritten --- relative paths only

The image handling pipeline has been rewritten to use the remark AST instead of
regex-based HTML string parsing.

**Breaking: absolute image paths are no longer resolved.** Paths like
`/assets/photo.jpg` in deck markdown are passed through as-is and will 404 on
subpath deployments. Use relative paths (`./assets/photo.jpg`) instead --- these
are resolved correctly for both the Vite plugin path (via ES module imports) and
the static HTML path (via `resolveImageUrl`).

**`processDeckMarkdown` accepts a `base` option.** The catch-all `[...slug].astro`
page passes `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` so that resolved relative paths include
the deployment base path in the generated HTML. This only affects the static
HTML path --- the Vite plugin path uses imports which Vite resolves natively.

**Migration:** change any `/assets/...` or `/images/...` paths in deck files to
`./assets/...`. Background images (`![bg](...)`) and inline images (`![](...)`)
both need relative paths. The build will fail visibly if an image path can't be
resolved, which is the intended behaviour.

### Internal changes

- `resolveAstImageUrls`: walks mdast to resolve relative image URLs in-place
  (replaces `resolveInlineImgSrcs`)
- `collectAstImageImports`: walks mdast to collect relative URLs into the import
  map with placeholder tokens (replaces `replaceRelativeImgSrcs`)
- `htmlToSegments`: splits stringified HTML on placeholders into segments
  (replaces regex-based `findRelativeImgSrcs` usage in vite-plugin.ts)
- `findRelativeImgSrcs` removed from vite-plugin.ts imports (still used by the
  Svelte preprocessor)

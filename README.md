# astromotion

Astro integration for markdown-authored slide decks powered by
[Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com), with a bit of
[Marp](https://marp.app) syntax mixed in.

This is shared in the spirit of openness and bonhomie, but it's really quite
idiosyncratic, and I don't expect anyone apart from
[me](https://github.com/benswift/) is going to find it useful.

### About the name

The name is a portmanteau of Astro +
[Animotion](https://animotion.pages.dev). Animotion (a Svelte wrapper around
Reveal.js) was the original runtime, but it was removed in favour of using
Reveal.js directly --- the Svelte runtime and SvelteKit shims weren't worth the
cost when 98% of decks are pure markdown. The name stuck because renaming a
package used across several projects isn't worth the churn.

## Install

```sh
npm install github:benswift/astromotion
```

## Setup

In your `astro.config.ts`:

```js
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
import { astromotion } from "astromotion";

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [astromotion()],
});
```

The integration registers `@astrojs/mdx` (only if no other integration has
already done so) and adds the deck remark plugins to Astro's global
markdown config, so it composes cleanly with themes that register mdx
themselves. It also injects the `/decks/[...slug]` catch-all route and
resolves your theme CSS. Slides are server-rendered HTML by default;
interactive components opt in to client-side hydration per component via
Astro's `client:*` directives.

**Important:** deck pages must not use Astro's `<ClientRouter />` --- it
conflicts with Reveal.js keyboard navigation.

## Writing slides

Create `.deck.mdx` files in `src/decks/`:

```
src/decks/
  my-talk.deck.mdx             -> /decks/my-talk/
  assets/
    photo.jpg
```

Top-level files use the filename stem as the slug. Subdirectories also work ---
a file named `slides.deck.mdx` maps to the folder root URL, and other names
become sub-paths:

```
src/decks/
  my-series/
    slides.deck.mdx            -> /decks/my-series/
    bonus.deck.mdx             -> /decks/my-series/bonus/
```

### Frontmatter

Decks support YAML frontmatter with these fields:

```mdx
---
title: My Talk
description: A talk about things
image: /og-image.png
---
```

All fields are optional. `title` falls back to the filename slug. `description`
defaults to "Slide deck". `image` defaults to `/og-image.svg`. These are used
for the page `<title>` and Open Graph / Twitter Card meta tags.

### Slide syntax

Slides are separated by `---` (thematic breaks). Each section becomes a
Reveal.js `<section>` element.

### Minimal example

```mdx
---
title: My Deck
---

import MyWidget from "../components/MyWidget.svelte";

# Hello

![bg](./photo.jpg)

---

## Slide with widget

<MyWidget client:visible prop="value" />

---

{/* _class: impact */}

**Big statement slide**

{/* notes: This is a speaker note. <em>HTML is supported.</em> */}
```

### Directives

MDX does not support HTML comments. Directives use MDX expression comment
syntax:

- `{/* _class: name */}` --- set a CSS class on the enclosing slide (e.g.
  `impact`, `banner`, `quote`, `centered`, or any custom class your theme
  defines)
- `{/* notes: ...HTML body... */}` --- presenter notes, visible in the
  Reveal.js speaker view (press **S**). The content is rendered as HTML.
- `{/* @include ./path.mdx */}` --- inline slides from another `.mdx` file
  (see Include directives below)

### Background images

Marp-inspired background image syntax:

- `![bg](./assets/photo.jpg)` --- full-bleed background
- `![bg contain](url)` / `![bg cover](url)` --- sizing
- `![bg left:50%](url)` / `![bg right:40%](url)` --- split layout (the
  percentage controls the image panel width)
- `![bg blur:5px brightness:0.7 saturate:1.5](url)` --- CSS filters (blur,
  brightness, and saturate can be combined freely)

Image paths must be relative to the deck file (e.g. `./assets/photo.jpg`).
Absolute paths like `/images/...` are not resolved and will 404 on subpath
deployments.

### QR codes

```mdx
![qr](https://example.com)
```

Generates an SVG QR code at build time, with CSS animations on the modules
(the little squares morph and shift colour). The animations respect
`prefers-reduced-motion`. The URL is displayed as a clickable link beneath
the code.

### Include directives

Inline slides from another `.mdx` file:

```mdx
{/* @include ./shared-intro.mdx */}
```

Paths are relative to the current deck file. Included content participates in
slide splitting --- thematic breaks inside the included file create new slides.
Only `.mdx` files are supported; rename any `.md` partials to `.mdx` first.
This is handy for sharing common slides (acknowledgements, logos, boilerplate)
across multiple decks.

### Components

Import any component framework Astro supports (Svelte, React, Vue, Solid,
etc.) at the top of the file and use it directly in slide content. Hydration is
opt-in per component:

```mdx
import MyWidget from "../components/MyWidget.svelte";
import AnotherWidget from "../components/AnotherWidget.jsx";

---

## Slide with components

<MyWidget client:visible />
<AnotherWidget client:load prop="value" />
```

Available `client:*` directives:

- `client:load` --- hydrate immediately on page load
- `client:visible` --- hydrate when the component enters the viewport
- `client:only="svelte"` --- render only client-side (skip SSR entirely)
- No directive --- render as static HTML, no JavaScript

### Code blocks

Fenced code blocks get syntax highlighting at build time via
[Shiki](https://shiki.style). The theme defaults to `vitesse-dark` but is
configurable --- see Options below.

### Smart typography

[Smartypants](https://www.npmjs.com/package/smartypants) runs on all slide
content, converting straight quotes to curly quotes, triple dashes to em
dashes, double dashes to en dashes, and triple dots to ellipsis characters.

## Theming

The default theme re-exports Reveal.js's built-in black theme. For custom
styling, create a CSS file and pass it to the integration:

```js
astromotion({ theme: "./src/decks/theme.css" });
```

Your theme CSS sets Reveal.js CSS variables and slide class styles. At a
minimum you'll want:

- **Reveal.js CSS variables** --- `--r-background-color`, `--r-main-color`,
  `--r-main-font`, `--r-main-font-size`, `--r-heading-color`,
  `--r-heading-font`, `--r-link-color`
- **Slide section base styles** --- padding, text-align, font-weight under
  `.reveal .slides section`
- **Slide classes** --- visual treatments for `banner`, `impact`, `quote`,
  `centered` (the classes available via `{/* _class: ... */}` directives)

### Structural classes reference

These classes are generated by the build pipeline and styled by the base theme.
Your custom theme layers on top:

| Class            | Purpose                                           |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `.slide-bg`      | Full-bleed background image (absolute positioned) |
| `.split-layout`  | Flex wrapper for split image/content slides       |
| `.split-image`   | Image panel in split layout (width set inline)    |
| `.split-content` | Content panel in split layout                     |
| `.qr-code`       | Container for generated QR code SVGs              |

### Sharing styles between your site and your decks

If your Astro site and your slide decks share a visual identity, extract the
common CSS custom properties into a shared file (e.g. `src/styles/common.css`)
and `@import` it from both your site's global stylesheet and your deck theme.

Keep context-specific things separate --- the website and decks have
fundamentally different rendering models (responsive layout vs a fixed 1280×720
viewport scaled to fill the screen), so root font size, layout tokens, and
Reveal.js `--r-*` variables should stay in their respective files.

### Font loading

The theme CSS should only _reference_ fonts (via `font-family`), not _load_
them. Use Astro's built-in font system in your `astro.config.ts`:

```js
export default defineConfig({
  fonts: [
    {
      name: "Your Font",
      cssVariable: "--font-your-font",
      provider: fontProviders.google(),
    },
  ],
});
```

## Options

```ts
astromotion({
  theme: "./src/my-theme.css", // custom theme CSS path (default: built-in black theme)
  injectRoutes: true, // inject /decks/[...slug] route (default: true)
  shikiConfig: { theme: "vitesse-dark" }, // full ShikiConfig (default: { theme: "vitesse-dark" })
});
```

The `shikiConfig` option accepts the full Astro `ShikiConfig` shape — single
theme via `theme`, or dual light/dark themes via `themes`:

```js
astromotion({
  shikiConfig: {
    themes: { light: anuLight, dark: anuDark },
    defaultColor: false,
  },
});
```

`codeTheme` (a single theme name) is accepted as a deprecated shortcut.

If you set `injectRoutes: false`, you'll need to create your own route pages.
See `pages/[...slug].astro` in this package for the reference implementation.

## Reveal.js configuration

The integration configures Reveal.js with these options:

- **1280×720** slide dimensions, no margin
- **linear navigation** (no 2D grid) with no on-screen controls
- **hash-based URLs** with 1-based indexing (`#/1`, `#/2`, etc.)
- **no transitions** between slides
- **CSS grid display** with centering (so `place-content: center` works in your
  theme CSS)
- **`viewDistance: 10`** for preloading nearby slides

These aren't currently configurable by the consumer --- they're hardcoded in the
catch-all route. If you need different settings, set `injectRoutes: false` and
write your own route.

## Deck listing page

The integration doesn't inject a listing page since it would need your site's
layout. Create your own at `src/pages/decks/index.astro`:

```astro
---
import YourLayout from "../../layouts/YourLayout.astro";
import { parseDeckFrontmatter } from "astromotion";
import fs from "node:fs";
import path from "node:path";

const decksDir = path.resolve("src/decks");
const decks = [];

for (const entry of fs.readdirSync(decksDir, { withFileTypes: true })) {
  if (entry.isDirectory()) {
    for (const file of fs.readdirSync(path.join(decksDir, entry.name))) {
      const match = file.match(/^(.+)\.deck\.mdx$/);
      if (!match) continue;
      const raw = fs.readFileSync(path.join(decksDir, entry.name, file), "utf-8");
      const { data } = parseDeckFrontmatter(raw, entry.name);
      const slug = match[1] === "slides" ? entry.name : `${entry.name}/${match[1]}`;
      decks.push({ slug, title: data.title ?? slug, description: data.description });
    }
  } else if (entry.isFile()) {
    const match = entry.name.match(/^(.+)\.deck\.mdx$/);
    if (!match) continue;
    const raw = fs.readFileSync(path.join(decksDir, entry.name), "utf-8");
    const { data } = parseDeckFrontmatter(raw, match[1]);
    decks.push({ slug: match[1], title: data.title ?? match[1], description: data.description });
  }
}

decks.sort((a, b) => a.slug.localeCompare(b.slug));
---

<YourLayout title="Decks">
  <h1>Decks</h1>
  <ul>
    {decks.map((deck) => (
      <li>
        <a href={`/decks/${deck.slug}/`}>{deck.title}</a>
        {deck.description && <span> --- {deck.description}</span>}
      </li>
    ))}
  </ul>
</YourLayout>
```

## PDF export

Requires [decktape](https://github.com/astefanutti/decktape):

```sh
npx decktape reveal --size 1280x720 http://localhost:4321/decks/my-talk/ output.pdf
```

Or use the bundled script, which builds, starts a preview server, exports, and
cleans up:

```sh
node node_modules/astromotion/scripts/deck-pdf.mjs my-talk output.pdf
```

The script waits up to 30 seconds for the preview server to respond and uses
generous pauses between slides (5 seconds load, 4 seconds per slide) to handle
heavy decks.

## Exports

The package exports:

- **`astromotion(options?)`** --- the Astro integration (this is what you use)
- **`deckRemarkPlugins`** --- the array of remark plugins in the correct order,
  exported for use when you manage `@astrojs/mdx` yourself
- **`parseDeckFrontmatter(raw, slug?)`** --- parse YAML frontmatter from a deck
  file (useful for listing pages)

## Migration from `.deck.md` / `.deck.svelte`

1. Rename `*.deck.md` and `*.deck.svelte` to `*.deck.mdx`.
2. For `.deck.svelte` files with a `<script lang="ts">` block, lift its
   contents to top-level MDX `import` and `export const` statements and drop
   the `<script>` wrapper.
3. Convert directive syntax from HTML comments to MDX expression syntax:
   - `<!-- @include ./path -->` → `{/* @include ./path.mdx */}`
   - `<!-- _class: name -->` → `{/* _class: name */}`
   - `<!-- notes: ... -->` → `{/* notes: ... */}`
4. Rename any `.md` partial files used by `@include` to `.mdx`.
5. Remove `@astrojs/svelte` and `deckPreprocessor` from your Astro config if
   they were only there for deck support. Add `@astrojs/mdx` as a dependency
   (the integration will register it automatically, but it must be installed).

Background image syntax, QR images, and slide separators are unchanged.
